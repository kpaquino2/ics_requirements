# A Specialized Degree Planner for UPLB Students

Authors: Kyle Edward P. Aquino and Asst. Prof. Rodolfo C. Camaclang III

This paper introduces a specialized degree planner web application designed for undergraduate students at the University of the Philippines Los Ba˜nos (UPLB). The planner aims to help students overcome challenges in following their prescribed curriculum by offering features such as prerequisite identification and unit requirement verification. It utilizes UPLB’s course and curriculum database to ensure accuracy and compliance with university rules. A user evaluation with UPLB undergraduates indicated above-average usability, though feedback suggested improvements in instructions and mobile-friendliness. Future work includes refining usability and exploring the planner’s impact on student success metrics.
